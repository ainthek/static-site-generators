# static-site-generators

Goal is to create more detailed comparison of static-site generators from

- content
- plugins
- theming (and predefined layouts)
- templating
- pipeline 
- and other aspects

I start with simple  spread sheet but will end in YAML and 
will try to consolidate with other repos (see links).
